        <h1>Seattle Design Festival 2018</h1>
        <h3>Theme: Trust</h3>
        <h3>Title: The Identity Bridge</h3>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>The focus of our installation is to ask participants
           about how they see themselves and how they present themselves to
           others in the workplace. It also questions whether or not these are
           aspects people are ready to share in the larger Seattle community. In
           the conversation space, questions on a rotating display inspire
           participants to consider various aspects of identity, which they can
           write on either side of a card (“To myself, I am…” & “To others, I am…”).
           Infographics and posters encourage conversation and sharing with
           others in the area. After contemplating individual identity, a
           participant can pin up their card on a communally built monument.
           Here, they are able to view the diversity of identities both inside
           and outside the workplace. Participants can relate, connect to, and
           understand others in their community. In order to bring the
           conversation of identity outside the installation, they can also have
           the option to take and keep pictures with their cards in front of the
           bridge.</p>
